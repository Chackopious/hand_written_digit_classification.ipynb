## Introduction

This project aims to classify handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale.

## Model

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model architecture includes:

- Input layer: Accepts 28x28 grayscale images
- Convolutional layers: For feature extraction
- Max-pooling layers: For downsampling
- Fully connected layers: For classification
- Output layer: Softmax activation to predict the digit class

## Installation

To run this project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab in your browser.
2. Upload the provided notebook file (`Hand_Written_Digit_Classification.ipynb`) to your Colab environment.
3. Ensure the necessary libraries are installed. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:


!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install tensorflow


## Usage

1. Open the notebook file (`Hand_Written_Digit_Classification.ipynb`) in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, define the model, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. After training, you can use the model to predict digits from new images.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 99% on the MNIST test dataset. The training process and evaluation metrics are detailed in the notebook.
